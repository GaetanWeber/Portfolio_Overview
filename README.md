## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I'll highlight several data analytics projects, offering brief descriptions of the technology stack utilized to tackle each project.

## Excel Projects

###  Bus Breakdown and Delays NYC Project
 
- [ US Breakdown and Delays NYC Project](https://github.com/GaetanWeber/Portfolio_projects/blob/main/Bus_Breakdown_and_Delays_NYC%20Project%20-%20Github.xlsx)

#### Description : 

This project is based on data from the New York Division of Transportation. 
Here's the scenario: 
I'm hired by the New York Division of Transportation as a Data Analyst to make the city's bus system better. The city has too many bus breakdowns and delays, making it hard for people and straining transportation. My job is to study the data to find out why these problems happen.
The following questions will be answered by analyzing the data:

- What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns? 
 - How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?
- Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?


Skills: Cleaning data, standardization, filtering and sorting, pivot table, pivot chart

###  US Debt Tracker Project
- [ US Debt Tracker Project](https://github.com/GaetanWeber/Portfolio_projects/blob/main/US%20Debt%20Tracker%20Project.xlsx)

#### Description : 

As Scenario, I was hired by a small debt agency in Washington DC that specializes in analyzing and forecasting public and private debt. The US Government has requested an in-depth analysis of their public and governmental debt to answer key questions about its growth and historical trends. Your job as a Data Analyst is to study the data and identify patterns and insights to guide the government’s financial decisions. The following questions will be answered by analyzing the data:


- What was the Yearly Debt Percentage Increase for each year compared to the previous year?
 - Which months historically have seen the highest and lowest increases in Total Debt?
- What is the projected growth of publicly held debt in the next few years?

Skills: Cleaning data, standardization, filtering and sorting, pivot table, pivot chart, **Forecasting**
